# Dependencies

# To Use
Only a single html file is required to configurate and open. I have merely tested it on chrome, so please tell me if other browsers encounter issues. 
Note to disable web security and allow files access: 
```
chrome.exe --disable-web-security --allow-file-access-from-files
```
